an application for getting to know people in a school/ professional setting

A standalone web app that does the introductions using PHP/MySQL - which can run on a student's site. 

We would want a data model for the information that includes a user table, and probably a table for attributes and another for values (so John is the user, an attribute is "Professional Background" and value is "Worked as an engineer for .....")  it will be 3 tables, but it may be necessary to add more tables. I'm not sure. 
Eventually we would want security, and roles, so that an admin could add and remove and edit everything, whereas the user could only edit their own entry. Probably, we would also need a log table for tracking changes and logins. Then viewers would have different rights and could search, view one or many... 
A rough prototype is here: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__wesome.us_CP-5FWEB250-5FSP2020_&d=DwIFAw&c=eyK8KBY19DualCOSet0JGw&r=-qYY0Igq-_79f8DH4ZPeM6WTOisUDhWgZ60Fr9OBrSY&m=_XVJWKrj25xxGMjTglDtLGiyFE_Vc2xIcuVFdUZjBqc&s=rFnZEfjsq319rgA2lTOQ737wAoiG--aummXB-F5gh5c&e=
